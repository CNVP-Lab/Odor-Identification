### Cues and smell
In this post we will try to explain this relationship between odor identification and clues using an experiment we performed.

> You have just woken up and your eyes are blurred, you see a yellow color in front of you, but its shape is unclear. It is at a distance where you cannot stretch your arms, and you feel the sharp smell of that thing. What do you think is the probability that this scent is banana or lemon?

## As a Distinctive Factor: Smell
:paperclip: The sense of smell cannot be figured out as much as the sense of sight and is still on the agenda as a research topic that still preserves its mystery. The sense of smell is the first sense that develops in the **mother's womb**. *When the babies are born, they can distinguish the mother's scent from other scents.*

Some animals have a much greater sense of smell than humans, and they even prefer to find their way by smell. Like, **bears'** olfactory bulb area is five times larger than human brain, have bigger noses which  contain thousands of smell receptors. That’s why they are the best sense of smell of any animal. About **dogs**, even thought they don’t have that much olfactory receptor genes, they can smell 100 times better than us. In their brain their evaluation of odors 40 times larger than the portion of a human brain. **Elephants** are one of the other which have best sense of smell because of their 2,000 unique genes for identifying scents in environment. **Snakes** smell with their tongues because they don’t have nostrils! In their mouth they collect the samples of air particles, water, soil and other various things.

For **humans**, smell can be seen as a sense that creates an association with the memories. The smell of one's grandmother's house, the smell of the mother's cookies or the smell of the first flower brought to us are engraved in our memories and at some point they can reappear before us. Odors may not always evoke positive emotions, some scents evoke negative emotions. These emotions might guide us to not eating a certain food or keeping away from a certain area.

*:paperclip: A distinctive feature of the sense of smell is that it is the only sense in the brain that goes directly to the olfactory cortex without going through the thalamus. The thalamus acts as a filter against various stimuli coming into the body.*

> > ***Have you ever wondered how our sense of smell can be influenced by letters or colors?***
  
:pushpin: Imagine being presented with different scents, **each associated with a specific letter or color**, and then being asked to identify them correctly. This study aims to explore the **intriguing world of odor** identification with letter or color clues. By understanding how our brains process these sensory cues, we can gain deeper insights into the complexities of our sense of smell and memory. 

> ***In our research, every participant smelled the two sets of odors with a color clue or letter clue(s) related to the smelling odor. After the clues, they waited to be guessed the correct odor.***

:lemon::banana:

> As a result of the data we collected, we observed that people mixed the scents of lemon:lemon: and banana:banana: against the yellow color hint. Perhaps this is confusing as to how these two scented items could have been confused, but this is not the only finding supports our findings!

This research has the potential to **unlock** new knowledge about which smells affected from these clues and is there a connection between these affected smells. So, let's embark on this **olfactory journey** to uncover the secrets of our sense of smell like never before!

## Pathway of the Olfactory Signals

<img width="618" alt="Berin 4" src="https://github.com/CNVP-Lab/Odor-Identification/assets/150802060/9f857173-49b9-407e-8450-934c29e6bb34">

It all starts with the detection of odorants in the environment released into the air from various sources like flowers, food, or other objects, they come in contact with our olfactory system. As we breathe in through our nose, the air carrying the odorant molecules enters our nasal passages. 

*More about physiology of smell* (click to open)

Inside our nasal cavity, there is a specialized tissue called the olfactory epithelium. This thin layer contains millions of tiny sensory cells known as olfactory receptor neurons. When the odorant molecules in the inhaled air reach the olfactory epithelium, they come into contact with the olfactory receptor neurons. Each olfactory receptor neuron possesses **specific receptor proteins** that are **sensitive to particular odorant molecules.** 


> > Do you know that we have **more than 350 types of olfactory receptors**? ***During the perception of an odor, several types of receptors are usually stimulated, not just one type of receptor.***


Then, when the odorant molecules bind to their corresponding receptors on the olfactory receptor neurons, it triggers a **biochemical response**. This response leads to the generation of electrical signals in the olfactory receptor neurons. 

*More about physiology of smell* (click to open)

In the olfactory bulb, the incoming signals are processed and sorted based on their specific characteristics. From the olfactory bulb, the processed signals are further relayed to **higher brain regions**, including the **olfactory cortex and limbic system**. 


> ***The olfactory cortex is responsible for **identifying** and **categorizing** different smells, while the limbic system is involved in processing **emotions** and **memory**.***


The brain compares the patterns generated by the olfactory bulb with stored information in our memory. If we have encountered a particular smell before and **associated it with certain emotions or experiences**, this information is **retrieved** and **linked to the current odor**. 


> ***Ultimately, based on the comparison and interpretation of the electrical patterns, our brain forms a perception of the smell. We can identify familiar scents, differentiate between various odors, and even experience emotional responses or triggers from certain smells.***

### Chosen Odors :mag_right: 
***1st set:*** Caramel, coke, banana, eucalyptus, onion, rose.

***2nd set:*** Coconut, anise, lemon, lavender, mushroom, grass.

> :pushpin: Selected odors in Burghart Messtechnik- Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test Blue and Purple sets are used for olfactory stimuli.

## Participants :busts_in_silhouette: 

Participants were chosen using criteria such that they show:

- [ ] *No respiratory disease*
- [ ] *Not consuming food, coffee, or tobacco products before the study*
- [ ] *Not used fragrance-containing products such as perfume*

> :pushpin: We divided participants into two groups:
   - The first group smelled “coconut, anise, lemon, lavender, mushroom and grass” while viewing colors;  the scents “caramel, cola, banana, eucalyptus, onion and rose” while viewing  letters.
   - The second group smelled “coconut, anise, lemon, lavender, mushroom and grass” while viewing letters; the scents “caramel, cola, banana, eucalyptus, onion and rose” while viewing colors.

## Application of the Experiment :paperclip: 

1. After resting for 5 seconds, participants saw the word “SMELL” on the screen. With this warning, the experimenter sniffed an odor stick for 2.5 seconds.

2.  Odor sticks are in the shape of a pen, and after opening the cap, they are positioned 2-4 cm from the middle of the nostrils and sniffing is performed.

3. After a 3 second break, the color compatible with the smell in experiment 1.1 and letters in experiment 1.2 are displayed for 1.5 seconds.

4. After the waiting screen, the participants pressed the space button and then they made an educated guess about what the scent is.

5. Each smell was presented 6 times in total, and each visual stimulus (color or letter) was presented 3 times.

## Results :tada: 

> ***:pushpin: For visualizing the data set of the odors and clues better, we prepared some images.***
Also, we chose to exclude the odors that have been predicted only once are not included in the data set.

We discovered that using **color cues** led to some confusion between the **coconut** and **vanilla scents**, possibly because both share the dominant **white** color. Similarly, caramel and vanilla scents seem to blend together, suggesting they could find applications in **desserts**:custard: like custard or **coffee**:coffee:. Therefore, their shared **'sweet edible'** characteristics appear to contribute to their blending.

<img width="618" alt="Berin 5" src="https://github.com/CNVP-Lab/Odor-Identification/assets/150802060/71fbdb27-244f-4c8b-a3da-9aa8c67fa877">

Our participants frequently guessed **vanilla and caramel** when they saw caramel color cues, and **vanilla and coconut**, when they saw letter cues. It is possible to confuse vanilla and caramel, which are similar in color, whereas confusion between coconut and vanilla followed by the word clues, may be explained by their similar categories(sweetener). Another explanation is that people in Turkey tended to use the word coconut with its English origin(in Turkish: hindistan cevizi), and that can be explain that coconut and caramel(karamel in Turkish) are similar in terms of their usage in Turkey.

In the case of the **coconut:coconut: scent**, we found that people often confused it with vanilla when they saw color cues. However, when given letter cues, the chances of guessing coconut were eight times higher than guessing vanilla. This color-based similarity in predictions may explain the confusion, whereas the difference in letter cues is likely because coconut and vanilla are quite different.

<img width="618" alt="Berin 6" src="https://github.com/CNVP-Lab/Odor-Identification/assets/150802060/e1e5a7a3-5d79-43f7-a135-d2b2b2f34aab">

> There were some popular predictions except from coconut, vanilla and caramel. Chocolate, milk and straweberry were also common guesses.

When we look at data from an **edible vs. non-edible scents** perspective, we see that **estimations of non-edible scents such as grass:seedling: or rose:rose:, are not as accurate as edible scents.** Since humans are  exposed to edible odors more often, it could be that the estimations are more accurate in this category. Grass odor was correctly predicted as grass in the presence of color cues. This approximately 4 times higher than the performance for vegetables. In letter clues, it was predicted 2 times more accurately than the second highest guess, which is the pine tree:evergreen_tree:. We think that the predictions here are due to the similarity of the Turkish words for pine tree and grass (çam & çim).

> With the color cues, there is a higher variety of predictions uttered. This is nearly 4 times more than with letter cues. Participants confused grass with tea in both color and letter cue conditions. 

When it came to the rose scent, participants made accurate predictions using either types of clues. When they smelled the rose scent, they often guessed products such as shower gel, rose water or essential oil which frequently incorporates the scent of roses.
